        <h1> Arjakan </h1>
        <p>Arjakan is shown to have unlimited shapeshifting abilities, 
            which allow for many and varied sight gags; however, 
            he is unable to kill anyone, make anyone fall in love, fully revive the dead, 
            or provide additional wishes. The Arjakan's supernatural abilities permit him to break the wall, 
            as well as parody real-life people and popular culture completely beyond the boundaries of his native universe.
