        <p> OIA has inspired <b>artists</b>, poets and every visitor who visits <strong>Santorini</strong>. Oia is best known for breathtaking sunsets; if truth be told, sunrise in Oia is also <i>magical</i>. In Oia there are two types of dwellings, the cave houses dug into the volcanic rock on the Caldera cliffs, and the Captains houses. </p>

        <h4> Algebra </h4>
        <blockquote> As a single word with an article or in the plural, "an algebra" or "algebras" denotes a 
            specific mathematical structure, whose precise definition depends on the context. Usually, the structure 
            has an addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication (see Algebra over a field). When some authors 
            use the term "algebra", they make a subset of the following additional assumptions: associative, commutative, 
            unital, and/or finite-dimensional, which allows for n-ary operations.
