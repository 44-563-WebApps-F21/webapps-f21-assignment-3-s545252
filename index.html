        <p> OIA has inspired <b>artists</b>, poets and every visitor who visits <strong>Santorini</strong>. Oia is best known for breathtaking sunsets; if truth be told, sunrise in Oia is also <i>magical</i>. In Oia there are two types of dwellings, the cave houses dug into the volcanic rock on the Caldera cliffs, and the Captains houses. </p>
